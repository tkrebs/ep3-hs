# ep-3 Hotelsystem

The ep-3 Hotelsystem is an open source (MIT licensed) web application for hotels and similar facilities,
which allows guests to check the availability of rooms and book them online.

Besides checking and booking of rooms, the system allows guests to choose from additional products and services
the hotel has to offer or activate hidden ones with coupon codes.

More features may be explored via our website (http://hs.hbsys.de/) or simply by downloading and trying the system
yourself.

The system was initially developed as a fork of the [ep-3 Bookingsystem] (http://bs.hbsys.de/), but quickly
evolved into an independent project.

## Documentation and installation

Documentation and installation instructions can be found in the following directory:

```
/data/docs/
```

Unfortunately, documentation and source code comments are rather spare at the moment (sorry).

## Architecture

The system is based on the well-known LAMP stack (Linux, Apache 2+, MySQL 5+, PHP 5.4+) and the popular and powerful
[Zend Framework 2] (http://framework.zend.com/) (2.3+).

Dependencies are managed with [composer] (https://getcomposer.org/).

The source code is version controlled with [Git] (http://git-scm.com/) and hosted at [GitHub] (https://github.com/).

The link to the GitHub repository is

where you can find stable and (latest) development releases.

## Version

The current version (August, 2014) is 0.81, as the software is not yet fully complete and might rather be considered as
in beta status. It is usable for production though.
